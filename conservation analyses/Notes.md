All conservation analyses were done in collaboration with the Ebersberger lab at Goethe University Frankfurt.

Genome assemblies of Gammaproteobacteria were collected from the NCBI Reference Sequence database (RefSeq release 213). The dataset comprises 2792 isolates distributed among 474 genera and 18 taxonomic orders (Table S8). 
Essential genes represented in the library were pulled from the genome assembly for A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (GCA_009759685.1). Orthology assignment was computed with the phylogenetic profiling tool fDOG v.0.1.26, compiling a maximum of 25 core-orthologs for each gene using a taxonomic distance minimum of genus and maximum of class. Visualizations were performed using PhyloProfile.
The ortholog presence ratio for each gene was measured within a taxonomic group by calculating the fraction of isolates possessing at least one ortholog out of the total number of analyzed isolates. We evaluated these ratios at the genus level with non-ACB (Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex) isolates, at the order level with non-Acinetobacter Moraxellales, and at the class level with non-Moraxellales Gammaproteobacteria.
