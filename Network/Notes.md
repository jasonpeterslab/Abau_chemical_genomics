Correlations of gene-level log2 fold changes (medLFC) were calculated in a pairwise manner for all essential genes present in the library, resulting in ~165k gene-gene correlations. As previously described [Peters: 27238023], a cutoff for correlation significance was determined through estimating background distribution of correlations by randomly permuting gene identities relative to medLFCs 5000 times. We used the 85% confidence interval of this background distribution, establishing a high correlation significance threshold of 0.758. The resulting 630 connections were visualized using Cytoscape v3.10.2 (Cytoscape Consortium).
