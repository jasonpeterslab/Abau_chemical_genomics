Guide-level and gene-level LFC/FDR outputs from our EdgeR code was used to describe and visualize essential gene library behavior.  

Most code directly takes the melted_results or median_melted_results variable from the EdgeR analysis: sequencing processing/Calculate-LFC-FDRs-EdgeR.R


Ortholog analyses was done in collaboration with the Ebersberger lab using fDOG: https://github.com/BIONF/fDOG.
