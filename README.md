# Chemical genomics - A. baumannii essential gene library
Code for manuscript in preparation for Molecular Systems Biology. Notes in each folder provide more methodological detail for scripts there.  

**Sequencing processing**: Initial sequencing data counting and QC  
**Fitness data and graphs**: Descriptions and visualizations of fitness data (e.g., chemical response graphs, heatmaps)  
**Chemical comparisons**: Chemical pathway effects and cheminformatics analyses  
**Network**: Code used to generate the essential gene network (final tables fed into Cytoscape for visualization)  


This code is meant to be a snapshot of code used, and this repo is unlikely to be heavily updated beyond this publication.
Questions about the publication can be addressed to the corresponding author.
