# Chemical genomics - A. baumannii essential gene library
Code and input files for manuscript in preparation for Molecular Systems Biology. Notes in each folder provide more methodological detail for scripts there. 
This code is meant to be a snapshot of code used, and this repo is unlikely to be updated beyond this publication.
Questions about the publication can be addressed to the corresponding author. 
Feel free to contact jentranxd or ryandward directly for more code-oriented consult (but no promises on response time).  

### Sequencing processing:    
Initial sequencing data counting and QC  

### Fitness data and graphs:  
Descriptions and visualizations of fitness data (e.g., chemical response graphs, heatmaps)  
All conservation/evolutionary analyses were done in collaboration with the Ebersberger lab at Goethe University Frankfurt.

### Chemical comparisons:  
Chemical pathway effects and cheminformatics analyses  
  
### Network:  
Code used to generate the essential gene network (final tables fed into Cytoscape for visualization; https://cytoscape.org/)
